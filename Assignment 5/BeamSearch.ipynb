        "# Text generation with pre-trained Transformers\n",
        "In this assignment we will work with Pre-trained Transformers such as GPT2 for generating text from a given sequence. Transformers aim to address the long term dependency issue in sequence-to-seuqence prediction by using concepts such as self-attention and positional encoding. GPT2 is a langauge model, pretrained on text generation, that can be used as a multi-task learner for tasks such as summarization, question-answering, and other generation tasks. This assignment's focus is on using GPT2 to generate text via greedy decoding and beam search. For more background on beam search, see [Jurafsky and Martin, chapter 11](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/11.pdf)."

Then, for the next token, find the $k$-best continuations for each of those $k$ hypotheses and select the $k$-best overall. Return the $k$-best overall hypotheses according to average log likelihood per word. Note that if we don't average per word, the decoder will simply prefer shorter outputs.
